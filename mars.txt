Keep going. Hope this works. Hi. Mars is a planet of interest for space 
colonization. It has water 
and 
microbial life. It has a red atmosphere. Mars lacks oxgen and human life 
supporting resources. Trip 1 from Earth to Mars: 1) establish stable 
power supply; 2) establish housing with atmospheric oxgen; 3) establish 
surveillance of systems.

Trip 2 from Earth to Mars: 1) establish food farms; 2) identify minerals 
and compounds; and 3) map topology.
